# 🌟 SkillSense – Unlock Your Hidden Potential

### 🧠 Developed for the **Hack-Nation Global AI Hackathon 2025**

SkillSense is an **AI-powered innovation** that transforms the way we **discover, analyze, and validate human potential**.  
By leveraging advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **semantic intelligence**, it uncovers hidden skills often missed by traditional resumes — bridging the gap between **what you’ve done** and **what you’re truly capable of**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In today's data-driven world, talent often goes unnoticed simply because it’s not explicitly stated.  
**SkillSense** solves this problem by extracting skills from multiple data sources like resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and GitHub repositories, and creates a **living, intelligent skill profile** — highlighting strengths, gaps, and growth potential.

> 🎯 *It’s not just about what you list on paper — it’s about what your data says about you.*
